  <br>I'm Erick! Soon to be a college freshman on his way to majoring in computer engineering. As you may already tell by the images, I'm passionate about many of my hobbies and can't wait to talk to you guys about it. <br> For one, I really enjoy the outdoors as I believe taking in the beauty of nature whether by just walking or even hiking is always a great experience that is not only relaxing but inspiring. Second, I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember and they played a big part of my childhood. Even now I sometimes happen to play old gamecube or psp games and get that nice rush of nostalgia that brings me many years back. <br>
  Music has always been a way for me to somehow escape from reality and really indulge in my own thoughts, feelings, or whatever is on my mind. Ask me for recommendations or put me on to new artists!</p>
